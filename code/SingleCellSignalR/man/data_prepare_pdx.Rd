\usage{
data_prepare_pdx(
  file.human,
  file.mouse,
  lower = 0,
  upper = 0,
  normalize = TRUE,
  write = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file.human}{a string for the scRNAseq data file}

\item{file.mouse}{a string for the scRNAseq data file}

\item{lower}{a number in [0,1], low quantile threshold}

\item{upper}{a number in [0,1], high quantile threshold}

\item{normalize}{a logical, if TRUE, then computes 99th percentile normalization}

\item{write}{a logical}

\item{verbose}{a logical}
}
\value{
The function returns a data frame of filtered and/or normalized data
with genes as row names.
}
\description{
Prepares the data for further analysis
}
\details{
`file_human` and `file_mouse` is the path to the file containing the read or UMI count
matrix the user wants to analyze.

`lower` and `upper` are used to remove the genes whose average counts are outliers.
The values of these arguments are fractions of the total number of genes and
hence must be between 0 and 1. Namely, if `lower = 0.05`, then the function
removes the 5% less expressed genes and if `upper = 0.05`, then the function
removes the 5% most expressed genes.

If `normalize` is FALSE, then the function skips the 99th percentile
normalization and the log transformation.

If `write` is TRUE, then the function writes two text files. One for the
normalized and gene thresholded read counts table and another one for the
genes that passed the lower and upper threshold. Note that the length of the
genes vector written in the *genes.txt* file is equal to the number of rows
of the table of read counts written in the *data.txt* file.
