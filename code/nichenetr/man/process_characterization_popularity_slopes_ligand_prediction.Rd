\title{Process the output of model evaluation for data source characterization purposes on the popularity bias assessment of ligand activity performance}
\usage{
process_characterization_popularity_slopes_ligand_prediction(output_characterization)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_characterization}{a list of lists containing the results of evaluation of different models (e.g. after execution of \code{evaluate_model}. Every sublist should contain at least the following elements: $model_name and $performances_target_prediction.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the popularity bias slopes in ligand activity prediction performances.
}
\description{
\code{process_characterization_popularity_slopes_ligand_prediction} will process output formed by model evaluation to get a data frame containing popularity bias measures in performance of ligand activity prediction.
